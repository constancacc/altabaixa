                </div>

                <div class="artigo1" style="margin-top: 5vh;">

                    <p class="texto"> For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer
                        who is
                        legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my
                        projects were set in five fonts:
                        Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="artigo1" style="margin-top: 5vh;">

                    <p class="texto">For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new
                        computer age,"
                        he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of
                        visual
                        pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic
                        ones, and
                        trash the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo,
                        Sabon and
                        Garamond No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for instance —
                        these were
                        distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it
                        again?
                        My Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I
                        accepted it gratefully.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="artigo1" style="margin-top: 5vh;">

                    <p class="texto">Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I
                        wanted, and
                        I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who
                        had attended

                        to public
                        school after eight years under the nuns: freed at last from demure plaid uniforms, they wore the
                        shortest
                        skirts they could find. "Jesus," she said, looking at one of my multiple font demolition
                        derbies.

                    <p class="texto">Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I
                        wanted, and
                        I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who
                        had attended
                        Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had switched
                        to public

                    <p class="texto">It was true. Liberated from monogamy, I became typographically promiscuous. I have
                        since,
                        I think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser, I learned that binges are
                        time-consuming, costly,
                        and ultimately counterproductive — but I've never gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those
                        thousands
                        of typefaces are still out there, but my recovery has required that I become more discriminating
                        and come up with some
                        answers to this seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface?

                <img src="./img/1.svg" alt="1" class="image1" />
                <div class="contentTitle1">Because it works</div>
                <div class="contentText1">Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic
                    fonts for
                    identity programs
                    that work beautifully in headlines and even in text, but sooner or later you have to set that really
                    tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card. This is what Franklin Gothic is for. Careful,
                    though: some typefaces work too well. Frutiger has been used so much for signage programs in
                    hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I'm about to get diagnosed with a brain
                    tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.</div>
                <img src="./img/2.svg" alt="2" class="image2" />
                <div class="contentTitle2">Because you like it´s history</div>
                <div class="contentText2">I've heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was
                    created the
                    same year the client's organization was founded. This must give the recommendation an aura of
                    manifest
                    destiny
                    that is positively irresistible. I haven't had that luck yet, but still try to find the same kind of
                    evocative alignment. For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo Novarese's Eurostyle, but I came to
                    love
                    it while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share an expressiveness peculiar to
                    the postwar optimism of the 1950's.</div>

                <div class="contentTitle3">Because you like it´s name</div>
                <div class="contentText3">Once I saw a project in a student portfolio that undertook the dubious
                    challenge of
                    redesigning the
                    Tiffany's identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely asked what it
                    was.
                    "Oh," came the enthusiastic response, "that's the best part! It's called Tiffany!" On the other
                    hand,
                    Bruce Mau designed Spectacle, the book he created with David Rockwell, using the typeface
                    Rockwell. I thought this was funny.</div>

                <div class="contentTitle2">Because of who designed it</div>
                <div class="contentText2">Once I was working on a project where the client group included some very
                    strong-minded
                    architects. I picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only well-suited to the
                    project’s requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect, Bertram
                    Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls’ school. I used a typeface that
                    was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko’s Mrs. Eaves. In both cases, my
                    clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of the story behind the font selection,
                    but took some comfort in it nonetheless.
                    I did too.</div>

                <div class="contentTitle3">Because it was there</div>
                <div class="contentText3">Sometimes a typeface is already living on the premises when you show up,
                    and it just seems mean to evict it. “We use Baskerville and Univers 65 on all our materials,
                    but feel free to make an alternate suggestion.” Really? Why bother? It’s like one of those
                    shows where the amateur chef is given a turnip, a bag of flour, a leg of lamb and some
                    maple syrup and told to make a dish out of it. Sometimes it’s something you’ve never used
                    before, which makes it even more fun.</div>
                <img src="./img/6.svg" alt="6" class="image3" />
                <div class="contentTitle2">Because they made you</div>
                <div class="contentText2">And sometimes it’s something you’ve never used before, for good reason.
                    “We use ITC Eras on all our materials.” “Can I make an alternate suggestion?” “No.”
                    This is when blind embossing comes in handy.</div>

                <div class="contentText3">Whenever I want to make words look straightforward, conversational,
                    and smart, I frequently consider Futura, upper and lower case. Why? Not because Paul Renner
                    was straightforward, conversational, and smart, although he might have been. No, it’s because
                    45 years ago, Helmut Krone decided to use Futura in Doyle Dane Bernbach’s advertising for
                    Volkswagen,
                    and they still use it today. One warning, however: what reminds you of something may remind someone
                    else of something else.</div>
