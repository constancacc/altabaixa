            </div>

            <div class="artigo1" style="margin-top: 5vh;">

                <p class="texto"> For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer
                    who is
                    legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my
                    projects were set in five fonts:
                    Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="artigo1" style="margin-top: 5vh;">

                <p class="texto">For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new
                    computer age,"
                    he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of
                    visual
                    pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic
                    ones, and
                    trash the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo,
                    Sabon and
                    Garamond No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for instance —
                    these were
                    distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it
                    again?
                    My Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I
                    accepted it gratefully.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="artigo1" style="margin-top: 5vh;">

                <p class="texto">Then, after a decade, I left my first job. Suddenly I could use any typeface I
                    wanted, and
                    I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who
                    had attended
                    Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had switched
                    to public

                    wanted, and
                    I went nuts. On one of my first projects, I used 37 different fonts on 16 pages. My wife, who
                    had attended
                    Catholic school herself, found this all too familiar. She remembered classmates who had switched

                    since,
                    I think, learned to modulate my behavior — like any substance abuser, I learned that binges are
                    time-consuming, costly,
                    and ultimately counterproductive — but I've never gone back to five-typeface sobriety. Those
                    thousands
                    of typefaces are still out there, but my recovery has required that I become more discriminating
                    and come up with some
                    answers to this seemingly simple question: why choose a particular typeface?

                            Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic fonts for identity programs that work beautifully in headlines and even in text,
                            but sooner or later you have to set that really tiny type at the bottom of the business reply card.
                            This is what Franklin Gothic is for. Careful, though: some typefaces work too well. Frutiger has been used so much for signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now makes me feel that I'm about to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.</div>

                            I've heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was created the
                            same year the client's organization was founded. This must give the recommendation an aura of
                            manifest
                            destiny
                            that is positively irresistible. I haven't had that luck yet, but still try to find the same kind of
                            evocative alignment. For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo Novarese's Eurostyle, but I came to
                            love
                            it while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share an expressiveness peculiar to
                            the postwar optimism of the 1950's.</div>

                            redesigning the
                            Tiffany's identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely asked what it
                            was.
                            "Oh," came the enthusiastic response, "that's the best part! It's called Tiffany!" On the other

                            Bruce Mau designed Spectacle, the book he created with David Rockwell, using the typeface

                            strong-minded
                            architects. I picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only well-suited to the
                            project’s requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect, Bertram
                            Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls’ school. I used a typeface that
                            was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko’s Mrs. Eaves. In both cases, my
                            clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of the story behind the font selection,
                            but took some comfort in it nonetheless.

Milton Glaser had based the logo on Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly. But Glaser's logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on Caslon Italic. I proposed we return to Caslon, and distinctly remember saying, "Bookman Swash Italic is always going to look ugly." The other day, I saw something in the office that really caught my eye. It was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked great. Ugly, but great.

Anything but a boring typeface, he felt, got in the way of the ideas. We settled on Trade Gothic.

It is the ultimate indulgence, but well worth the extra effort. Is this proliferation? I say bring it on.

The designers at Experimental Jetset have made the case for Helvetica. My partner Abbott Miller had a period of life he calls "The Scala Years" when he used that typeface almost exclusively. When the time is right, I might make that kind of commitment myself.

I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers — it has no pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set each one of the 79 pieces in a different typeface. I loved this idea, but wasn't sure how far he'd want to go with it. "What about the one called 'I Hate ITC Garamond?'" I asked him. "Would we set it in ITC Garamond?" He looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he said.
    The book is beautiful, by the way, and not the least bit slutty.

                Type Design is a domain that multiple times has profited from the emergence of new tools and technologies. The transformation of type from physical to digital, the dissemination of font design software and the adoption of web typography make type design better known and more accessible. This domain has received an even greater push with the increasing adoption of generative tools to create more diverse and experimental fonts. Nowadays, with the application of Machine Learning to various domains, typography has also been influenced by it. In this work, we produce a dataset by extracting letter skeletons from a collection of existing fonts. Then we trained a Variational Autoencoder and a Sketch Decoder to learn to create these skeletons that can be used to generate new ones by exploring the latent space. This process also allows us to control the style of the resulting skeletons and interpolate between different characters. Finally, we developed new glyphs by filling the generated skeletons based on the original letters’ stroke width and showing some applications of the results.

                    The design of type has undergone numerous changes over time [4]. In the early years, typography was seen as a system made up of a series of rules. The artistic movements that arrived at the beginning of the twentieth century rejected the historical forms and transformed outdated aspects of visual language and expression.

                    However, projects that combined software, arts and design only appeared a few years later with the proliferation of personal computers, allowing programming to reach a wider audience. Thanks to all these changes, the tools to design type changed, and new possibilities for typographic experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) grammar-based techniques that explore the principle of database amplification (e.g. [2]); (ii) evolutionary systems that breed design solutions under the direction of a designer (e.g. [22, 15]); (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems that learn the glyphs features to build new ones (e.g. [14]) [18].

                    These computational approaches can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration. Most emerging fonts continue to be developed by type designers who study the shape of each letter and its design with great precision, despite the emergence of these new possibilities. Type design is a hugely complex discipline, and its expertise ensures typography quality [28]. Moreover, with the proliferation of web typography and online reading, the use of variable and dynamic fonts has increased, allowing more options for font designers and font users. Additionally, visual identities created nowadays are becoming more dynamic [17]. Museums, institutions, organisations, events and media increasingly rely on this type of identity.

                    Consequently, designers should adapt their work to these new possibilities by creating dynamic identities with animations and mutations. Even though new computer systems create expressive and out-of-the-box results, they do not have the knowledge of an expert. But this is also an advantage, allowing non-arbitrary exploitation that extends the range of possibilities. It is necessary to create a balance to take advantage of the computational systems and the expert labour. Moreover, most generative systems that design type focus on the letters’ filling and don’t see the structure of a glyph as a variation parameter.

                    To overcome these limitations, we propose an Autoregressive model [9] that creates new glyph skeletons by the interpolation of existing ones. Our skeleton-based approach uses glyphs skeletons of existing fonts as input to ensure the quality of the generated results. The division of the structure and the filling of the glyphs add variability to the results. <br><br><br>
                    Different glyphs can be created by just changing the structure or the filling. The proposed approach enables the exploration of a continuous range of font styles by navigating on the Autoencoder (AE) learnt latent space. With the results of this approach, it is also possible to apply different filling methods that use the stroke width of the original letters to produce new glyphs (see Figure 1).

                    The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections. The following section, Related Work, analyzes related projects in the domain of computational typography with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The second section, Approach, describes the construction of the used dataset and explains the training process. Then, in the Results section, we present and discuss the different exper- imentations performed and the obtained results. In this section, we also present a set of different possible applications of the outputs of our system. In the final section, Conclusion and Discussion, we draw some conclusions and lay out future work.
