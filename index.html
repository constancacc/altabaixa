                <p class="texto"> For the first ten years of my career, I worked for Massimo Vignelli, a designer
                    who is
                    legendary for using a very limited number of typefaces. Between 1980 and 1990, most of my
                    projects were set in five fonts:
                    Helvetica (naturally), Futura, Garamond No. 3, Century Expanded, and, of course, Bodoni.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="artigo1" style="margin-top: 5vh;">

                <p class="texto">For Massimo, this was an ideological choice, an ethical imperative. "In the new
                    computer age,"
                    he once wrote, "the proliferation of typefaces and type manipulations represents a new level of
                    visual
                    pollution threatening our culture. Out of thousands of typefaces, all we need are a few basic
                    ones, and
                    trash the rest." For me, it became a time-saving device. Why spend hours choosing between Bembo,
                    Sabon and
                    Garamond No. 3 every time you needed a Venetian Roman? For most people — my mom, for instance —
                    these were
                    distinctions without differences. Why not just commit to Garamond No. 3 and never think about it
                    again?
                    My Catholic school education must have well prepared me for this kind of moral clarity. I
                    accepted it gratefully.
                </p>

                            Some typefaces are just perfect for certain things. I've specified exotic fonts for identity
                            programs that work beautifully in headlines and even in text,
                            but sooner or later you have to set that really tiny type at the bottom of the business
                            reply card.
                            This is what Franklin Gothic is for. Careful, though: some typefaces work too well. Frutiger
                            has been used so much for signage programs in hospitals and airports that seeing it now
                            makes me feel that I'm about to get diagnosed with a brain tumor or miss the 7:00 to O'Hare.

                            I've heard of several projects where the designer found a font that was created the
                            same year the client's organization was founded. This must give the recommendation an aura
                            of
                            manifest
                            destiny
                            that is positively irresistible. I haven't had that luck yet, but still try to find the same
                            kind of
                            evocative alignment. For instance, I was never a fan of Aldo Novarese's Eurostyle, but I
                            came to
                            love
                            it while working on a monograph on Eero Saarinen: they both share an expressiveness peculiar
                            to
                            the postwar optimism of the 1950's.</div>

                            redesigning the
                            Tiffany's identity. I particularly disliked the font that was used, and I politely asked
                            what it
                            was.
                            "Oh," came the enthusiastic response, "that's the best part! It's called Tiffany!" On the

                            strong-minded
                            architects. I picked Cheltenham, an idiosyncratic typeface that was not only well-suited to
                            the
                            project’s requirements, but was one of the few I know that was designed by an architect,
                            Bertram
                            Goodhue. Recently, I designed a publications program for a girls’ school. I used a typeface
                            that
                            was designed by a woman and named after another, Zuzana Licko’s Mrs. Eaves. In both cases,
                            my
                            clients knew that the public would be completely unaware of the story behind the font
                            selection,
                            but took some comfort in it nonetheless.

Milton Glaser had based the logo on Bookman Swash Italic, a typeface I found unimaginably dated and ugly. But Glaser's logo had replaced an earlier one by Peter Palazzo that was based on Caslon Italic. I proposed we return to Caslon, and distinctly remember saying, "Bookman Swash Italic is always going to look ugly." The other day, I saw something in the office that really caught my eye. It was set in Bookman Swash Italic, and it looked great. Ugly, but great.

Anything but a boring typeface, he felt, got in the way of the ideas. We settled on Trade Gothic.

It is the ultimate indulgence, but well worth the extra effort. Is this proliferation? I say bring it on.

                            Sometimes I think that Massimo Vignelli may be using too many typefaces, not too few. A true fundamentalist requires a monotheistic worldview: one world, one typeface. The designers at Experimental Jetset have made the case for Helvetica. My partner Abbott Miller had a period of life he calls "The Scala Years" when he used that typeface almost exclusively. When the time is right, I might make that kind of commitment myself.

I wanted it to feel like a real book for readers — it has no pictures — so I asked Abbott to design it. He suggested we set each one of the 79 pieces in a different typeface. I loved this idea, but wasn't sure how far he'd want to go with it. "What about the one called 'I Hate ITC Garamond?'" I asked him. "Would we set it in ITC Garamond?" He looked at me as if I was crazy. "Of course," he said.
    The book is beautiful, by the way, and not the least bit slutty.

                Type Design is a domain that multiple times has profited from the emergence of new tools and technologies. The transformation of type from physical to digital, the dissemination of font design software and the adoption of web typography make type design better known and more accessible. This domain has received an even greater push with the increasing adoption of generative tools to create more diverse and experimental fonts. Nowadays, with the application of Machine Learning to various domains, typography has also been influenced by it. In this work, we produce a dataset by extracting letter skeletons from a collection of existing fonts. Then we trained a Variational Autoencoder and a Sketch Decoder to learn to create these skeletons that can be used to generate new ones by exploring the latent space. This process also allows us to control the style of the resulting skeletons and interpolate between different characters. Finally, we developed new glyphs by filling the generated skeletons based on the original letters’ stroke width and showing some applications of the results.

                    The design of type has undergone numerous changes over time [4]. In the early years, typography was seen as a system made up of a series of rules. The artistic movements that arrived at the beginning of the twentieth century rejected the historical forms and transformed outdated aspects of visual language and expression.

                    However, projects that combined software, arts and design only appeared a few years later with the proliferation of personal computers, allowing programming to reach a wider audience. Thanks to all these changes, the tools to design type changed, and new possibilities for typographic experimentation appeared, resulting in (i) grammar-based techniques that explore the principle of database amplification (e.g. [2]); (ii) evolutionary systems that breed design solutions under the direction of a designer (e.g. [22, 15]); (iii) or even, Machine Learning (ML) systems that learn the glyphs features to build new ones (e.g. [14]) [18].

                    These computational approaches can also be helpful as a starting point of inspiration. Most emerging fonts continue to be developed by type designers who study the shape of each letter and its design with great precision, despite the emergence of these new possibilities. Type design is a hugely complex discipline, and its expertise ensures typography quality [28]. Moreover, with the proliferation of web typography and online reading, the use of variable and dynamic fonts has increased, allowing more options for font designers and font users. Additionally, visual identities created nowadays are becoming more dynamic [17]. Museums, institutions, organisations, events and media increasingly rely on this type of identity.

                <p>
                    Consequently, designers should adapt their work to these new possibilities by creating dynamic identities with animations and mutations. Even though new computer systems create expressive and out-of-the-box results, they do not have the knowledge of an expert. But this is also an advantage, allowing non-arbitrary exploitation that extends the range of possibilities. It is necessary to create a balance to take advantage of the computational systems and the expert labour. Moreover, most generative systems that design type focus on the letters’ filling and don’t see the structure of a glyph as a variation parameter.

                    To overcome these limitations, we propose an Autoregressive model [9] that creates new glyph skeletons by the interpolation of existing ones. Our skeleton-based approach uses glyphs skeletons of existing fonts as input to ensure the quality of the generated results. The division of the structure and the filling of the glyphs add variability to the results. <br><br><br>
                    Different glyphs can be created by just changing the structure or the filling. The proposed approach enables the exploration of a continuous range of font styles by navigating on the Autoencoder (AE) learnt latent space. With the results of this approach, it is also possible to apply different filling methods that use the stroke width of the original letters to produce new glyphs (see Figure 1).

                    The remainder of this paper is divided into three sections. The following section, Related Work, analyzes related projects in the domain of computational typography with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The second section, Approach, describes the construction of the used dataset and explains the training process. Then, in the Results section, we present and discuss the different exper- imentations performed and the obtained results. In this section, we also present a set of different possible applications of the outputs of our system. In the final section, Conclusion and Discussion, we draw some conclusions and lay out future work.

                            to evolve and adapt their process of thinking in accordance. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
                            have revealed impressive advances, presenting high-resolution images nearly indistinguishable 
                            from the real ones.

                    <p class="texto2" style=" z-index: 3;"> The framework uses a manifold learning technique that allows for interactively improving the
                        fit quality and interpolating, adding or removing stylistic elements in existing fonts. Campbell and 
                        Kautz [3] develop a similar contour-based framework allowing the editing of a glyph and the propagation 
                        of stylistic elements across the entire alphabet. Phan et al. [19] and Suveeranont and Igarashi [26] 
                        present two different frameworks that give one or more outline-based glyphs of several characters as input, 
                        producing a complete typeface that bears a similar style to the inputs.

                        alphabet, creating glyphs that share different style features. Azadi et al. [1] develop an end-to-end
                        stacked conditional GAN model to generate a set of highly-stylised glyph images following a consistent
                        style from very few examples.

                    <p class="texto2">We can also imitate the behaviour of a variable font using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
                        and interpolate to obtain intermediate results. Lopes et al. [14] model the drawing process of fonts by
                        building sequential generative models of vector graphics. Their model provides a scale-invariant
                        representation of imagery. The latent representation may be systematically exploited to achieve style
                        propagation. Shamir and Rappoport [24] present a parametric feature-based font design approach. 
                        The development of a visual design system and the use of constraints for preserving the designer's 
                        intentions create a more natural environment in which high-level parametric behaviours can be defined.

                    <p class="texto2" style="z-index:2; position: relative;">By changing the glyph parameters they create several family instances.
                        Also, outside the typographic field, there are some good examples exploring the latent space. 
                        Sketch-RNN [7] is an RNN able to construct stroke-based drawings. The network produces sketches of
                        common objects in a vector format and explores the latent space interpolation of various vector images. 
                        There is also increased attention to these networks and their application to facilitate the use and 
                        combination of fonts. A usual way to combine different fonts is by using fonts from the same family or 
                        created by the same designer. Another way is to find fonts that match x-height and ascenders/descenders. 
                        Fontjoy [20] is another tool to facilitate the process of mixing and matching typefaces and choosing fonts 
                        to use side by side. FontMap [8] and Font-VAE [10] are tools developed with the goal of discovering 
                        alternative fonts with the same aesthetics.

                    <p class="texto2"> One of the most important aspects of our approach is the collection 
                        and pre-processing of the dataset. We compile a collection of fonts in TTF font format with different 
                        weights from Google Fonts [6]. This dataset is composed of five different font styles, Serif, Sans Serif, 
                        Display, Handwriting and Monospace. We opted not to use handwriting and display fonts because they were 
                        largely distinct from the rest, which is not desirable for our approach. Their ornamental component, 
                        sometimes not even filled, complicates the extraction of a representative skeleton. We only worked with 
                        26 characters (A-Z) of the Latin alphabet in their capital format. We believed that, as a work in progress, 
                        it would be best to create a dataset with a few characters. By just using capital letters, we are reducing 
                        the complexity of the approach.

                    <p class="texto2" >After selecting the fonts, we remained with 2623 
                        TTF files. Then, we use the library Skelefont [16] to extract the skeleton of a font file. It applies 
                        the Zhang-Suen Thinning Algorithm [29] to derive the structural lines of a binary image. This library 
                        also allows the extraction of the points of the skeletons as well as the connections between them. It 
                        can also calculate the distance between the points and their closest borderline pixel, returning the 
                        stroke width of the original glyph at each of these points. For each font, we rasterise the vectors 
                        that compose the skeleton of each glyph into a 64x64px black and white image. We also save all points'
                        positions and stroke width of the original glyph in a file to use later to generate the filling of 
                        the glyphs. Then, we repeat the process for the 26 letters of the alphabet (capital letters of the Latin
                        alphabet only). This process is shown in the first three images of the diagram in Figure 2.

                    <p class="texto2">The proposed model consists of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (VAE) [11] and an 
                        Autoregressive sketch decoder. We used a VAE instead of a regular AE to allow us to manipulate the 
                        latent vectors more easily. The output of the VAE are the parameters of distribution instead of vectors 
                        in the latent space. Moreover, the VAE imposes a constraint on this latent distribution forcing it to be
                        a normal distribution which makes sure that the latent space is regularised. Therefore, we can create
                        smoother transitions between different fonts when we sample the latent space moving from one cluster
                        to the other. The Conditional part of the model allows us to input which letter we are encoding and
                        decoding allowing us to manipulate better which letter we are creating. Finally, as all the letters
                        share the same latent space we can also explore the skeletons between different letters.

                    <p class="texto2" style="width: 21vw">Figure 2 shows a diagram of the architecture used. In summary, the encoder employs a 
                        Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that processes the greyscale images and encodes them into two 64-D 
                        latent vectors which consist of a set of means (μ) and standard deviations (σ) of a Gaussian 
                        representation. Through experimentation, we found that size 64 for the latent code presents the best 
                        results for our approach as it is a good trade-off, allowing us to compress all the characteristics of 
                        the letter while keeping its tractability. Then, using the mean and standard deviation we take a sample 
                        from the Gaussian representation z to be used as input for both decoders, the image decoder and the 
                        sketch decoder. The image decoder consists of a set of convolutional transpose layers that receive the 
                        z vector and decodes it into a greyscale image which is compared with the original input. The sketch 
                        decoder consists of an LSTM [9] with dropout [25, 23] that transforms the z vector into a sequence of 
                        30 points creating a single continuous path.

                    <p class="texto2" style="width: 21vw" >This path is rasterised using a differentiable vector graphics library [13] to produce
                        an output image. This library allows converting vector data to a raster representation while
                        facilitating backpropagation between the two domains. In the rasterisation process, we take the 
                        sequence of 30 x and y values and transform them to canvas coordinates. Then, we create a line that 
                        connects all points following the same order they are returned from the sketch decoder. The width of 
                        this path needs to be carefully selected to match the width of the original skeleton. If the width of 
                        the path is thinner than in the original images, at some part of the training process, the network stops
                         trying to compose the whole letter and starts to fill the width of the letter in a zig-zag manner. 
                         However, if the line is thicker than in the original images we lose detail in the final skeleton.

                        that is compared with the original image. Although the standard VAE works at the pixel level, the 
                        output of our sketch decoder is a sequence of points, thus allow- ing the generation of scalable vector
                        graphics that allow easier manipulation of the generated skeletons without losing quality. The loss
                        value is calculated in a similar way as in the standard VAEs. We calculate the Binary Cross Entropy
                        between the output images of the image decoder and the original inputs. We also calculate the 
                        Kullback-Leibler Divergence [12] to allow a regularised distribution of the latent space. 
                        Finally, we compute the Binary Cross Entropy between the original inputs and the output of 
                        the sketch decoder. To obtain the final loss value we add the three values together.

                    As mentioned before, the model returns a sequence of points that, when connected, create a
                    reconstruction of
                    the skeleton image used as input. In most cases, the generated strokes reconstruct the basic
                    features of the skeleton.
                    For example, in the case of the letter “A”, the network first creates one stem, then the crossbar
                    connects both stems
                    and finally draws the second stem. Even though there is nothing to control the distance between
                    points or to enforce
                    them to be close, the network learns that it needs to connect both stems at the beginning and the
                    end of the sequence.
                    Another interesting feature observable in the reconstruction is related to how the ANN handles the
                    letter “T”. This letter
                    presents one of the simplest skeletons of the alphabet, so the network can learn how to generate the
                    whole structure of
                    the letter very quickly in comparison with others.

                    Figure 3 presents a comparison between the original inputs and the reconstructed skeletons using a
                    single stroke.
                    The reconstructions of “C”, “L” or “K”, for example, are very similar. The letters “A”, “X” and “K”
                    present a more complex
                    challenge to the network as it needs to create a path that overlaps itself to draw the whole letter
                    structure with only one
                    line. Sometimes, the serif is lost in the reconstruction due to the same issue. The line must
                    overlap itself multiple times
                    to create the small parts without messing with the overall structure of the letter. But the other
                    reason for this could be
                    that the number of letters with serif is lower than the number of letters without it. In summary,
                    even though the small
                    details of the letters might be lost, our network is able to create the minimal structure of the
                    letter, generating skeletons
                    that cannot be confused with any other letter.

                    To understand if the trained model can learn a latent representation for the different letters that
                    is smooth and interpretable, we need to visualise the 64-dimensional z vectors for the dataset. So
                    we
                    take all the images of the dataset (68198 images) and encode them using our network. Then, using the
                    means and standard deviations of each encoded image we took a sample from the distribution. Finally,
                    we took all the z vectors and reduced their dimensionality using the t-SNE algorithm [27]. This
                    allows
                    us to reduce the z vectors from a size of 64 to two dimensions which can be translated to positions
                    in
                    a two-dimensional domain. For each position of a two-dimensional grid, we place the image of the
                    best
                    candidate. We select this candidate by finding the two-dimensional encoding closest to that
                    position.
                    Figure 4 presents the visualisation of the results. In general, the model can separate the different
                    letters into clusters. In some cases, it is also possible to observe that similar letters are placed
                    near each other, for example in the case of the letters “B”, “R” and “P”. These three letters
                    present
                    similar anatomical characteristics, they share a top bowl and they all have a vertical stem, thus
                    they
                    are placed near each other. The same happens for the letters “T” and “I” which are placed more
                    separately from the rest but near each other.
                </p>

                <p class="texto2Art2">
                    Even though the majority of the skeletons for the letter “I” is represented with a single stem,
                    in some cases, when they have serif, they are similar to the letter “T” but with a cross stroke on
                    the top and bottom part of the letter. This leads to both letters having a strong similarity between
                    each other, therefore they are placed together in the latent space. We also create a similar
                    representation
                    contemplating the skeleton images of a single letter (2623 images). To understand if the trained
                    model was
                    able to smoothly change styles within the same letter we created a similar visualisation as in
                    Figure 4.
                    Figure 5 presents the visualisation of the results for the letter “R”. As it is possible to observe,
                    the
                    model is able to separate the different font weights across the latent space, creating different
                    regions.
                    The zoom-in boxes show four separate locations where we notice a concentration of specific font
                    styles.
                    In (A) it is presented a region where the condensed fonts are, while the opposite corner (D)
                    represents
                    the most extended fonts. It is also possible to observe that (B) represents the italic, and finally
                    (C)
                    presents most of the fonts with serifs. Local changes within these regions are also visible, where
                    the
                    font width increases when distancing from the region (A) and approximating to the region (D). It is
                    also possible to observe a slight increase in the font height in the top-bottom direction.

                    representation,
                    we explore linear interpolations between pairs of skeletons for a given glyph. First, we encode two
                    randomly
                    selected fonts from the dataset into their corresponding z vectors. Then, we perform a linear
                    interpolation
                    between the two vectors and, using the trained sketch decoder, we reconstruct the skeletons for
                    these vectors.
                    Figure 6 shows some results of this exploration. The first and last glyph of each row are the
                    original skeletons,
                    and in the middle are the interpolations between them two. The interpolation percentage starts at 0%
                    and ends
                    at 100%, which means that the second skeleton is a reconstruction of the glyph on the left side, and
                    the
                    penultimate skeleton is a reconstruction of the glyph on the right</p>

                    The results show that the model is not only able to decode meaningful skeletons but it is also able
                    to
                    control several characteristics of it. In the example of the letter “N”, not only the model can
                    control
                    the width of the letter, but it also controls its height.

                <p class="texto2Art2">
                    As it is possible to observe in the interpolations presented in Figure 6, not only the model is able
                    to decode meaningful skeletons but it is able to control several characteristics of it. In the
                    example of the letter “H”, the width of the letter is slightly changed until it matches the width of
                    each skeleton input image. In the case of the letter “N”, not only the model is able to control the
                    width of the letter, but it also controls its height. At the same time the width of the letter
                    changes, its height is also modified to match its parents, which allows wider control over the
                    skeleton that can be created. In the case of the letter “T”, it is possible to observe that the
                    model can also control how much the letter is italic. As we go from the left input skeleton image to
                    the right, the stem of the letter gets closer to a vertical position. This not only shows that the
                    model is capable of perceiving different angles but it can also transition between them gradually.
                    Therefore, we might be able to control all these stylisations of the skeletons by navigating the
                    latent space. This can be observed in the visualisation shown in Figure 5. There are certain regions
                    dedicated to different letter styles. So, we can navigate this space in order to create fonts that
                    demonstrate a set of desired styles.
                </p>

                <p class="texto2Art2">
                    We also interpolate between skeletons of different letters. By observing the resulting skeletons
                    present in Figure 7, we observe that the model is able to pass from one skeleton to another from
                    different letters. Sometimes the morphings are not even expected to be smooth, because some letters
                    have anatomical parts completely different, like for instance the “Z” and “T”. The generated
                    skeleton starts as “Z” but over time it loses its bottom crossstroke. Moreover, its diagonal stroke
                    slightly changes its angle and transforms itself into the stem of a “T”. There are also other
                    transformations that are expected, such as the case of “P” and “F”, which share a stem. Over the
                    line, the generated skeleton opens its bowl to create the arms of the “F” and at the same time
                    slightly inclines the stem to create an italic glyph according to the inclination of the “F”.
                    Another information that we can obtain is that sometimes we start to visualise intermediate
                    skeletons that look like other existing letter’s skeletons. For example, when we explore the latent
                    space between “G” and “L” in some intermediary steps we can observe some resemblance with the letter
                    “C”.

                So far, we have demonstrated how our system is able to reconstruct and create new skeletons through
                the exploration of latent space. However, our goal is to develop a tool to support the design
                process by allowing the creation of artificial variable fonts or morphing fonts, so it is imperative
                to test the application of the generated skeletons.

                As mentioned before, the skeleton extraction library [16] allows, in addition to extracting the
                points, obtaining the stroke width at each point of the skeleton. When we created the dataset, by
                extracting the skeletons of the uppercase letters of the Latin alphabet for each font file that we
                selected, we saved the points of each skeleton and its stroke width to use posteriorly. With these
                values, we were able to interpolate the stroke width along with the generated skeleton. The process
                of filling the generated skeletons is the following. First, we randomly choose two skeletons to
                interpolate. Then, we calculate the stroke width at each point of the generated skeletons. To do
                this, we calculate the corresponding point on the skeletons that serve as input for the creation of
                intermediate skeletons. We do this calculation by overlapping the input skeletons and the generated
                skeleton and calculating the closest match. The stroke width at each point is a result of combining
                the interpolation of the widths of the input skeletons.
            </p>

            <p class="texto2Art2">
                Figure 8 shows some results in which each row represents a different interpolation. Looking at the
                generated glyphs, we can see that they look similar to a regular font. With a few adjustments, we
                could use them as a variable font. Now, with interpolated fill, the contrast between variations is
                more visible, because we had another parameter to the glyph design. By splitting the skeleton and
                the filler we have more visual possibilities because we are not stuck with a filler. In these tests,
                we use filling in the original fonts to fill in the intermediate ones, but it is not mandatory. We
                can even use some fonts to create the skeleton and others to create the filling or even use a fixed
                value along the skeleton. By applying the filling, the interpolated glyphs become more unique, by
                suffering more alterations when moving between the two input glyphs. For example, in the “S” (Figure
                8) we can observe that besides the axis alteration, the glyphs also change in contrast. The
                generated “S” near the left is styled more like a modern font, with high contrast and serifs. From
                left to right the contrast inside the generated glyphs turns almost nil and they lost the serifs.

                As mentioned before, our system provides a tool to facilitate the process of building these dynamic
                identities with a typographic component. With this tool, designers can generate skeletons and
                develop a filling to create their versions of glyphs. To demonstrate the application of our system
                we made a series of experimentations with different ways of using the obtained skeletons by our
                model (see Figure 9 and 10).
                In the first application (Figure 9), we present the interpolation* between two input glyphs. The
                input glyphs are represented in red and light blue while the generated one is in dark blue. To
                visualise the three superimposed glyphs, we apply the multiply effect, thus obtaining another colour
                that represents the common parts between the generated and the original ones. The generated glyphs
                are very diverse on a visual level, enabling the design of a dynamic visual identity with the use of
                only two fonts. We believe that the mutating factor of these results provides an identity that is
                easily placed side by side with the dynamic visual identities and variable fonts that are made these
                days. In the second application (Figure 10), the generated glyphs use just the interpolated
                skeletons. The stroke width is also calculated based on the input glyphs. However, the filling is
                further away from the traditional typographic visual aspect. Along the skeleton line, we draw a
                series of crosswise line segments to define the width of the glyph’ stroke. The density changes to
                accommodate the same number of line segments between each pair of points.

                    most typefaces are developed by type designers, who study the design and anatomy of each character with great precision. 
                    Type design is a difficult and time-consuming process. Our approach takes advantage of the knowledge present in the design 
                    of a typeface and the computational possibilities that ANNs provide.

                    <p class="texto-5">We propose a VAE combined with an Autoregressive model to generate glyphs’ skeletons by interpolating existing ones.
                        Our contributions are the following, a sketch decoder capable of (i) reconstructing images of glyphs’ skeletons using a single 
                        stroke, (ii) controlling font styles by navigating the latent space, (iii) interpolating between two skeletons to create new ones. 
                        By creating interpolations between existing fonts we develop a method to help designers in making their artificial variable fonts, 
                        easing the usual glyph production. We also explored a feature of a skeleton extraction library, which calculates the stroke width at each point of the letter skeleton, to produce a 
                        fill for the generated skeletons. By interpolating between skeletons of different letters we are creating new glyph forms that resemble other existing glyphs. This opens up new exploration possibilities for the future. We envision that our approach can find use as a tool for graphic designers to facilitate font design. We can employ this system to generate new skeletons, which the designer can fill with the desired style, but also be used as inspiration seed to create new glyphs.

                        <p class="texto-5">We expect to make several future contributions. First, we want to change the architecture of the sketch decoder to be able to use multiple strokes. In some cases, our 
                            approach was able to draw skeleton letters that require more than one line by overlapping them. However, if the sketch decoder had access to multiple strokes, this problem 
                            could be solved more easily. Finally, we intend to change the input of the network so it can receive a vector version of the skeletons instead of a 
                            pixel-based image. This way we can work with an end-to-end architecture focused on vector format leading to better quality skeletons without any loss 
                            of information.
